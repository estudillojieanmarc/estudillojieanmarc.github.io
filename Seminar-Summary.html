            <h5>EVENT SUMMARY</h5>
            <P>The 2 speakers sharing their experience when they are still studying. And they said don't give up on our dreams specially when we create our capstone project we need to help each other to finish it. Then they decided to create a Library system to give us a tip how to do web application in a good way. I'm glad because it helps me because 
            i want to be a web developer in the future. Actually when they give a motivational speech about being a Web developer i feel excited because i want to experience being an IT personnel. Before we achieve our goal we need to work hard and study hard to reach our dreams. And they said don't be afraid to ask question specially to the professor, adviser or the experts to help us in our capstone project. I believe in IT industry we need to help each other and give an idea or an Information to 
            achieve our goal. This is the last part of the webinar and they still finish their Library system. When i watched them while their coding, i realized being a web developer is not easy because we need knowledge and skills to create a website and a system. But they always reminded us to not give up while we creating a website or a capstone project and be patient specially to the days that we feel upset or down we need to remember that we have friends or family that always supporting us. </P>
